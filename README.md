# .NET Distributed Application

## Overview
Sample application using .NET to test and demonstrate techniques/patterns to use when building a real-world distributed application.

I have various goals for this project (listed below) where each demonstrates or contributes towards a feature needed when building a real-world distributed application.
Some goals have value just within themselves. Some goals will also drive out other useful best practice patterns.
